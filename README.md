# Tasks

## Task 1: Data Type Conversion
**Objective:** Explore data type conversion in JavaScript.

### Description:
1. Create a JavaScript program that demonstrates data type conversion. Start with a variable `num` assigned the value `42` (as a number).
2. Convert `num` into a string and store it in a new variable called `strNum`.
3. Display the result, and ensure that `strNum` is indeed a string using **typeof**.


## Task 2: Working with Arrays
**Objective:** Learn to work with arrays in JavaScript.

### Description:
1. Develop a JavaScript program that defines an array of your choice, e.g., an array of fruits and add content to it.
2. Perform the following operations on the array
    1. Adding new element at the end of the array
    2. Removing element from the end of the array
    3. Accessing specific elements providing the index (order) of that element
    4. Print out the length of the array
3. Display the updated array after each of these array operations.


## Task 3: Custom JavaScript Object
**Objective:** Create a custom object in JavaScript.

### Description:
1. Develop a JavaScript program that defines a custom object called "person" using a plain JavaScript object literal.
2. Include properties `name`, `age`, and `email` in your custom object.
3. Display the properties of the "person" object using `console.log`.


## Task 4: Using Built-in Objects
**Objective:** Utilize built-in JavaScript objects.

###  Description:
1. Write a JavaScript program that utilizes a built-in object, such as the `Math` or `Date` object.
2. Use methods or properties of the built-in object to perform mathematical operations or retrieve useful information.
3. Display the results of these operations or information.


## Task 5: Comparison Operators
**Objective:** Understand and apply comparison operators in JavaScript.

1. Use `prompt()` to ask the user to enter two variables, `value1`  and `value2`,
2. Convert the user-entered values to numbers using `parseFloat()`.
3. Use comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`) to compare `value1` and `value2`.
4. Display the results of these comparisons in a meaningful format, like *"Is x greater than y? [true/false]"*.


## Task 6: Logical Operators
**Objective:** Explore logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) in JavaScript.

1. Declare three variables, `bool1`, `bool2`, and `bool3`, and assign them Boolean values.
2. Use logical operators to perform logical operations on these variables.
3. Display the results of the logical operations.


## Task 7: Increment and Decrement
**Objective:** Practice increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators.

1. Declare a variable, `counter`, and initialize it to a numeric value.
2. Use the increment and decrement operators to modify the `counter` variable.
3. Display the updated value of `counter` after each operation.


## Task 8: Assignment Operators with Error Handling
**Objective:** Learn about assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) and practice error handling using try...catch.

### Description:
1. Declare a variable, `total`, and assign it an initial value.
2. Use various assignment operators to update the `total` variable.
3. Wrap the assignment operations in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors.
4. In the `catch` block, log any errors that may occur during the assignment operations.
5. After the `try...catch` block, display the final value of `total` or an appropriate message indicating that an error occurred.
